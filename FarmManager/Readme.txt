The Farm Manager is an addon that will help you track your Farm.  It displays a list of items you have farmed this session, the price of each stack of items and the total price of all items.  It also shows the gold per minute that you are making.

To install, unzip the archive and move the FarmManager folder into your \Documents\Elder Scrolls Online\live\AddOns folder.  Once there, you will need to load the game and activate the addon.  Once activated, you will need to /reloadui to load the addon.

Before starting the first time, go into the addon settings and select which merchant software you are using by setting Use MM to either on or off.  If this switch is on, the addon will use Master Merchant to get prices for each item.  If it is off, it will use Arkadius' Trade Tools.  If the selected addon is not present, it will use the game pricing.

The commands for this addon are:

/farm - Shows the tracking window
/farm start - Starts tracking your farmed items
/farm stop - Stops tracking farmed items
/farm show - Shows the tracking window
/farm reset - Resets the list of farmed items and the tracking window
/farm hide - Hides the tracking window

There is also a button on the tracking window that can be used to transfer all farmed items for this session from your craft bag to your backpack.  

Known issues:
If you click the Transfer to Backpack button twice in the same session, the addon is probably going to crash.  I'm trying to decide how best to handle this.

Troubleshooting:
Q:  It doesn't work!
A:  You're going to have to be a little more specific than that.

Future improvements:
Add functionality that will transfer the items to your bank or guild bank.  That's been posing some interesting issues, especially the guild bank.
Pause feature so that a Farm session can be paused and restarted without skewing your gold per minute count.
Player to player transfer.  Not sure if this is possible, but I'm looking into it.
Anything else that you can think of that might be a good idea.
